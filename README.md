# Home-Security-System-Based-on-SIM800

Home security system based on SIM800 is a security system that uses a SIM card to send and receive text messages. It is designed to detect any unauthorized entry into a home and alert the homeowner via text message and call to their mobile phone. The system made up of a control panel (main board), sensors, and sirens.

<br>
The sensors can be placed on doors, windows, and other areas around the home to detect any movement or disturbance. When the sensors are triggered, the control panel sends a few calls and text messages to the homeowner's phone, notifying them of the disturbance. This type of home alarm system is often preferred by those who want to be alerted of any security breaches immediately, even if they are not at home.

Additionally, this type of system can be controlled remotely via text message, allowing the homeowner to turn the system on or off, and to check its status from anywhere at any time.

## Setup


### Hardware setup

|   Setup  | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Learn wireless sensor     | After configuring the sensor address jumpers, press and hold the button on the board for 3 seconds until the board emits 2 consecutive beeps. Now, release the button quickly and move the wireless sensor (connect the sensor power) if you want to learn the sensor. The board will emit 2 consecutive beeps to confirm successful learn. If an error occurs during the learn process, the board will emit only one beep.        |
| Remove the wireless sensor     | Press and hold the setting button on the board for 3 seconds until the board emits 2 consecutive beeps. Now, quickly release the button and activate the wireless sensor (connect the sensor's power). If the sensor is successfully removed, the board will emit 3 beeps. If there is an error in the deletion process, the board will emit only one beep (similar to the repetition in the sensor Learn process).        |
| Learn the remote's Activate button     |   Press and hold the button on the board for 6 seconds until the board emits 3 consecutive beeps. Now, quickly press the activate button on the remote control. If you successfully learn this button to your device, the board will emit 2 consecutive beeps. If there is an error in the learn process, the board will emit only one beep. |
| Remove the remote's Activate button    | Press and hold the button on the board for 6 seconds until the board emits 3 consecutive beeps. Now, quickly release the button and press the activate button on the remote control. If you successfully remove this button from the device, the board will emit 3 consecutive beeps. If there is an error in the deletion process, the board will emit only one beep. |
| Learn the remote's Disable button     |  Press and hold the button on the board for 9 seconds until the board emits 4 consecutive beeps. Now, quickly press the disable button on the remote control. If you successfully learn this button to your device, the board will emit 2 consecutive beeps. If there is an error in the learn process, the board will emit only one beep.         |
| Remove the remote's Disable button     |  Press and hold the button on the board for 9 seconds until the board emits 4 consecutive beeps. Now, quickly release the button and press the disable button on the remote control. If you successfully remove this button from the device, the board will emit 3 consecutive beeps. If there is an error in the deletion process, the board will emit only one beep.|
| Cancel the Learn or Remove process     | If you encounter any issues during the process of learn or remove the sensor or remote, or if you wish to cancel the process, simply press the settings button on the board. The device will notify you by emitting a single beep and cancel the process.    |
| Erase all remotes and sensors     | If you wish to erase all the data and settings on the device, including mobile phone numbers, sensors, activate and disable buttons of remotes, and more, simply hold the button on the device for 20 seconds until the board emits 5 consecutive beeps. Once you release the button, the device's memory will be completely erased.        |
